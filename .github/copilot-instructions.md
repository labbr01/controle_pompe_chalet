# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be newly initialized or empty. No source files, documentation, or project-specific conventions were found. As such, there are no established architectural patterns, workflows, or integration points to document at this time.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- If you are initializing a new project, follow best practices for your chosen language and framework.
- When adding files, prefer clear naming and modular structure.
- If you add build, test, or run scripts, document them in a README.md at the project root.
- Update this file as the project evolves to reflect new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions.

## Next Steps
- Once code or documentation is added, update this file to provide actionable, project-specific guidance for future contributors and AI agents.
